# Aviation Toolkit

The **Aviation Toolkit** is a Python-based application that provides a collection of tools for aviation-related calculations and unit conversions. It offers functionalities for pilots, aviation enthusiasts, and professionals to perform various calculations commonly used in the aviation industry.

## Features

The Aviation Toolkit includes the following features:

1. **Dead Reckoning Calculator**: Calculate estimated latitude and longitude based on course, speed, and time.

2. **True Airspeed (TAS) Calculator**: Determine the True Airspeed given the altitude and Equivalent Airspeed (EAS).

3. **Ground Speed Calculator**: Calculate the ground speed of an aircraft considering airspeed and wind conditions.

4. **Off-Course Correction Calculator**: Calculate the heading correction needed to get back on course.

5. **Fuel Endurance Calculator**: Determine the endurance of an aircraft based on fuel amount and burn rate.

6. **Rate of Descent Calculator**: Calculate the rate of descent needed for a standard descent profile.

7. **Top of Descent (TOD) Calculator**: Find the point for initiating the descent to the destination airfield.

8. **Distance Traveled Calculator**: Calculate the distance traveled based on speed and time.

9. **Time of Arrival (TOA) Calculator**: Determine the estimated time of arrival at a destination based on remaining distance and ground speed.

10. **Unit Converter**: Perform unit conversions for various aviation-related quantities, including temperature, distance, volume, weight, length, and pressure.

## Usage

1. **Dead Reckoning Calculator**: Provides a graphical interface to input course, latitude, longitude, speed, and time for latitude and longitude estimation.

2. **True Airspeed Calculator**: Input altitude and Equivalent Airspeed (EAS) to calculate True Airspeed (TAS).

3. **Ground Speed Calculator**: Calculate ground speed by entering TAS, wind speed, wind direction, and aircraft direction.

4. **Off-Course Correction Calculator**: Enter the distance off course, distance flown, and distance remaining to find the heading correction.

5. **Fuel Endurance Calculator**: Estimate aircraft endurance by entering the total fuel amount and average fuel burn rate.

6. **Rate of Descent Calculator**: Determine the rate of descent needed by providing the ground speed.

7. **Top of Descent (TOD) Calculator**: Calculate the TOD point based on current altitude, airfield altitude, rate of descent, and ground speed.

8. **Distance Traveled Calculator**: Provides a simple interface to calculate distance traveled with speed and time inputs.

9. **Time of Arrival (TOA) Calculator**: Calculate the estimated time of arrival by entering remaining distance and ground speed.

10. **Unit Converter**: Access a collection of unit conversion tools for temperature, distance, volume, weight, length, and pressure.
